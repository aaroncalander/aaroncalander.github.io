		<h3>Additional Resource:</h3>
			<a href="http://www.insidejobs.com/careers/professional-beer-taster">More on becoming a beer taster.</a>
		<p>This website gives a good overview on what you need to become a beer taster and what the job truly entails. Although I don't find the layout of the page to be very appealing or clear, it does have some good links to beer tasting certificate programs as well as a few related jobs. Overall, I am not very impressed with this website.
